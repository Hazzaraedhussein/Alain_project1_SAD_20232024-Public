# System Analysis and Design (SAD) Course

## Course Description
Welcome to the SAD course! 
The main focus of this course is to provide a practical approach of systems analysis and designing skills for the students using structured methodology. Hence the course enables students to study information system requirements for any system application within an organizational context. The contents are sequentially organized directly from planning, analysis, designing and implementation phases. From the resulting output of the planning and analysis phase shall enable students to form input, output and interface design. Hence a prototype design can be demonstrated.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
1. Analyze the concepts of system development life cycle (SDLC) in an information systems project using structured methodology
2. Design phase based on requirement in real-world case study using structured 
methodology.
